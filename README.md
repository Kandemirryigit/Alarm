<hr/>

<h1>How works?</h1>
-the main idea of the project:Firstly you should answer how much seconds you wanna set up your alarm.Your answer is going to be second be careful about it.If you set up 3600 seconds it means 1 hour.If you set up 60 seconds it means 1 minute.The main idea is that.After you set up your alarm you just have to wait computer is going to count back.
